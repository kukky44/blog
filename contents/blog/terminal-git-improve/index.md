## Install iTerm2

iTerm2 is an alternative application for Terminal.

By using this, you can change typefaces, background opaque, and so on.

Also, there is an amazing feature called Hotkey Window. Once you register a shortcut, the Hotkey brings iTerm2 to the foreground when you are in another application.

To know more details and install, visit [https://www.iterm2.com](https://www.iterm2.com).

## Make the terminal screen beautiful

You can change styles of the terminal screen by using [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh).
It enables you to decorate the terminal screen and check the current git branches or status.

I changed it thanks to [this post](https://medium.com/@Clovis_app/configuration-of-a-beautiful-efficient-terminal-and-prompt-on-osx-in-7-minutes-827c29391961).
