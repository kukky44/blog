[iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/) is an alternative application for Terminal.

By using this, you can change typefaces, background opaque, and so on.

Also, there is an amazing feature called Hotkey Window. Once you register a shortcut, the Hotkey brings iTerm2 to the foreground when you are in another application.
